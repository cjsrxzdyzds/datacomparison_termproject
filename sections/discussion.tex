\subsection{Compression-Complexity Trade-off}
% Analyze the fundamental trade-off
Our results reveal a clear trade-off between compression performance and computational complexity. [Detailed analysis to be filled based on results]

\subsubsection{Model Complexity vs. Compression Gain}
Higher-order models generally achieve better compression, but with diminishing returns. For instance, [specific example from results].

\subsubsection{Practical Implications}
For applications with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited CPU}: First-order Markov or FSM models provide good balance
    \item \textbf{High compression priority}: Third-order Markov or neural models
    \item \textbf{Real-time requirements}: FSM models with specialized state machines
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Type Characteristics}

\subsubsection{Text vs. Binary Data}
Text data shows [pattern], while binary data exhibits [different pattern]. This suggests [explanation].

\subsubsection{Structured Sequences}
DNA and protein sequences benefit significantly from [specific model type] due to [biological/structural reason].

\subsection{Model Selection Guidelines}
Based on our experiments, we recommend:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Recommended Model} \\ \hline
Text & Speed & 1st order Markov \\ \hline
Text & Compression & 3rd order Markov \\ \hline
Binary & Balanced & FSM \\ \hline
DNA & Compression & 2nd order Markov \\ \hline
General & Adaptive & LSTM (if resources allow) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Model selection guidelines based on data type and priority.}

\subsection{Limitations}

\subsubsection{Implementation Constraints}
Our MATLAB implementation may not reflect optimized C/C++ performance. [Discuss impact]

\subsubsection{Dataset Coverage}
While we tested diverse data types, [limitations in scope].

\subsubsection{Neural Model Training}
Online training of neural models during compression presents challenges: [discuss challenges and how they were addressed].

\subsection{Future Work}
Promising directions for future research include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid models combining Markov and neural approaches
    \item Context mixing techniques to leverage multiple models
    \item Hardware acceleration for neural probability models
    \item Adaptive model selection that switches based on data characteristics
\end{itemize}

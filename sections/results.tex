\subsection{Model Correlation Analysis}
To understand the relationship between different probability models, we analyzed the correlation of their probability predictions on a test sequence.

\caption{Pearson correlation matrix of model probability predictions.}
\label{fig:correlation}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:correlation} illustrates the correlation matrix. Key observations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Correlation}: The 1st Order Markov model and FSM model show extremely high correlation ($>0.98$) on random/unstructured data, suggesting they capture very similar statistical properties in the absence of distinct patterns.
    \item \textbf{Orthogonality}: The RNN model shows low correlation with statistical models, indicating it captures fundamentally different information. This suggests that mixing an RNN with a Markov model would likely yield better compression than mixing two Markov models.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling Analysis}
To better understand how our models perform as data size increases, we analyzed the relationship between file size and both compression ratio and encoding time.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Impact of file size on compression ratio. Note the log scale on the x-axis.}
\label{fig:size_vs_ratio}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:size_vs_ratio} shows that compression ratios generally improve (decrease) as file size increases, particularly for adaptive models like the 3rd Order Markov, which benefit from observing more data to build accurate probability tables.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/size_vs_time.png}
\caption{Encoding time vs. file size (log-log scale).}
\label{fig:size_vs_time}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:size_vs_time} illustrates the time complexity. The linear relationship on the log-log plot confirms that most models scale linearly with input size ($O(N)$), but with vastly different constants. The RNN and 3rd Order Markov models show a much steeper intercept, indicating high per-symbol processing costs.
